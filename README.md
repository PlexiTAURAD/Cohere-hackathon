# Cohere-hackathon
Repository of my project for the cohere hackathon

The idea of my project is to create a customer support program which can guide a customer, connect them to the required department, extract important data from the interaction and also summarise the interaction between the customer and the AI. I would also want to automatically send an email to the customer saying that their report is being processed.

Thw output will be in JSON. This project will display a bar graph plotting the confidence of the model for each option. It will also display the output as the option with the most confidence
